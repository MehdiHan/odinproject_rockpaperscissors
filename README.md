# The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Introduction

In this project we create a mini "Rock,Paper,Scissors" game.

At the start of the project the game was played through the console.

## Evolution

I have add HTML structure and some CSS, now we can chain games.

Each game will return final result from 5 rounds.
